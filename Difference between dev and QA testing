Broader-involves testing the entire system,functionality and user experience.                                                 Narrower-focuses on individual code or unit-level testing.                                               
Includes functional,integration,system,regression and user acceptance testing.                                                Includes unit testing,integration testing and sometimes some functional testing.                 
QA engineers or testers are responsible for testing and reporting issues.                                                     Developers are responsible for writing and running tests(e.g unit tests) on their code.                                                                
QA often uses test automation tools ,bug tracking tools and performance testing tools.                                        Developers use debugging tools,unit testing frameworks and static analysis tools. 
Ensures the software works as expected from the user perspective.                                                             Ensures that individual code units are error-free and function as expected.                        
QA testers report defects found in the system or integration level.                                                           Developers report bugs related to the code they’ve written during development.
