Principles of Testing:
The Principles of Testing guide the overall approach to software testing and help ensure that testing is thorough,efficient and effective.Here are the key principles:
1.Testing Shows the Presence of Defects
Testing can only prove the existence of bugs or issues in software,not their absence.If no defects are found,it doesn't necessarily mean there are no defects.it just means none were detected.
2.Exhaustive Testing is Impossible
It’s impossible to test all combinations of inputs and scenarios in most cases.Instead,we aim for effective testing with a risk-based approach,focusing on the most important and high-risk areas.
3.Early Testing
The earlier you begin testing in the development cycle,the cheaper and more efficient it is to fix bugs.Testing should start as soon as possible in the development process.
4.Defect Clustering
A small number of modules or components often contain the majority of defects.Focused testing on these areas can help find the most significant issues.
5.Pesticide Paradox
Running the same set of tests repeatedly will eventually stop finding new defects.To improve the effectiveness of testing,the tests need to be updated and expanded regularly.
6.Testing is Context-Dependent
Testing methods and approaches should be adapted to the context of the project.For example,testing a mobile app may require different approaches than testing a web-based enterprise application.
7.Absence of Errors Fallacy
Finding and fixing bugs is important,but if the software does not meet the user's needs or requirements,it is still not useful.Testing needs to ensure the software solves the right problem.
